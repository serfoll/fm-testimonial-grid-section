          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny’s worth.
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span>&quot;</span>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the
          bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
          people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
          intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
          thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time
          of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched
          careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

          was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself.

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
          easy.
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span>&quot;</span>The staff seem genuinely concerned about my
          progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the
          confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
          myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
          You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible
          community of smart and amazing people.<span>&quot;</span>

        <h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
        <p>
          <span>&quot;</span>Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a
          line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help
          me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
          former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
          program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
          very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
          team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
          the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,
          I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
          developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
          full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
          recommend!<span>&quot;</span>
